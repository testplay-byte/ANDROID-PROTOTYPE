## [Unreleased]

### 2025-01-15 — Documentation pass (v7): comprehensive docs for next AI agent

**Goal:** Make the repository fully self-documenting so any future AI agent can understand the project, the rules, and how to build a prototype without guessing.

**New documentation files:**
- `docs/agent-quickstart.md` — 2-minute fast-start guide condensing everything an agent needs to begin work.
- `docs/prototype-blueprint.md` — detailed, step-by-step blueprint for building a new prototype (11 steps + common pitfalls table).
- `docs/repo-map.md` — visual annotated tree of the entire repository, with quick-lookup tables and a navigation-file chain diagram.

**Updated documentation:**
- `STARTUP.md` — expanded the repository layout tree to show all 12 doc files + `index.html`; added new docs to the quick-lookup table; updated "Last updated" line; added prototype-blueprint as the first step in "How to Create a New Prototype".
- `navigation.md` (root) — fixed the `.github/` link (was broken); added `index.html` to top-level files table; added links to agent-quickstart, repo-map, prototype-blueprint, preferences, theme-architecture; updated "Last updated".
- `docs/navigation.md` — added the 3 new docs to the files table; rewrote the reading order to be a 10-step progressive path; updated "Last updated".
- `prototypes/_template/navigation.md` — completely rewritten to reflect v6 (4 screens, 32px corners, 5px bezel, 13px punch-hole, scoped theming, click-drag scroll, fullscreen API, no Bluetooth, side panels, what NOT to change).
- `prototypes/_template/README.md` — rewritten with v6 features and correct links.
- `prototypes/navigation.md` — updated "Last updated".
- `templates/navigation.md` — updated "Last updated".
- `assets/navigation.md` — updated "Last updated".
- `.github/navigation.md` — updated "Last updated".
- `README.md` — added links to agent-quickstart, repo-map, prototype-blueprint; updated the repository structure tree to include `index.html` and `_template/` v6.

**Result:** The repository now has 12 documentation files in `docs/` + 7 `navigation.md` files across directories + `STARTUP.md` + `README.md` + `CHANGELOG.md`. Any AI agent can start from `STARTUP.md` → `docs/agent-quickstart.md` → `docs/repo-map.md` and find anything in under 2 minutes.

### 2025-01-15 — Template v6 (click-drag scroll + real Fullscreen API)

**Template (`prototypes/_template/`) — v6:**

- **Click-drag-to-scroll (desktop):** the device screen now supports pressing and dragging the mouse to scroll in any direction. The cursor shows `grab`/`grabbing` hints. Interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs, toggles) are excluded so their clicks still work. A drag >3px suppresses the click event to prevent accidental navigation. Native wheel/trackpad scrolling still works. Only activates on `pointer: fine` devices (doesn't interfere with mobile touch scrolling).
  - **Root cause of the old issue:** global `selectstart`/`dragstart` event listeners were blocking all drag gestures. These have been **removed**. Text selection is now prevented purely via CSS `user-select: none`, which doesn't block scrolling.
- **Real Fullscreen API (mobile):** the floating fullscreen button now calls `device.requestFullscreen()` — the real browser Fullscreen API. This hides the browser address bar, tab bar, and (on Android) the system status bar, giving a true native-app full-screen experience. Pressing the button again or Esc exits. Best-effort orientation lock to portrait on Android.
  - **Fallback:** CSS-only `.device--cssfs` class (fills viewport without hiding browser chrome) for browsers without Fullscreen API support (e.g. iOS Safari on iPhone).
  - `:fullscreen` / `:-webkit-full-screen` pseudo-class CSS rules handle the fullscreen layout.
- Removed the old `.device--framed` class (was toggling framed view on mobile — no longer needed; the Fullscreen API replaces it).

**Docs:**
- `docs/preferences.md` — new "Scrolling (desktop)" section; updated "Mobile experience" to describe the real Fullscreen API.
- `docs/template-rules.md` — new §7b "Click-drag-to-scroll (desktop)"; rewrote §7 "Mobile full-screen experience" to describe the Fullscreen API + fallback.

### 2025-01-15 — Template v5 (scoped theming, thicker bezel, bigger punch-hole) + detailed docs

**Template (`prototypes/_template/`) — v5:**
- **Scoped theming (CRITICAL fix):** the app's dark mode toggle now changes ONLY the device's theme, never the whole page. `data-theme` is set on `.device`, not `<html>`. CSS variables split into two layers: page-level (`--stage-bg`, `--sb-*`) on `:root` (fixed), app-level (`--color-*`, `--chart-*`) on `.device` (changes with theme). The page background, side panels, and body text stay light when the app goes dark.
- **Bezel slightly thicker:** 3px → **5px** (per feedback: "not too much but just a little bit thicker").
- **Punch-hole bigger:** 10px → **13px** (per feedback).
- **Adaptive bezel color:** near-black (`#1a1612`) in light mode (stays black, per user); medium-gray (`#3a3530`) in dark mode — visible against both the light page and the dark app screen, doesn't interfere with either.
- JS: `setTheme` now sets `data-theme` on `device` element; localStorage key changed to `proto-app-theme` (separate from any page theme).

**Docs (highly detailed):**
- New `docs/theme-architecture.md` — full explanation of the page/app theme separation, token tables, architecture diagram, what-NOT-to-do list, testing steps.
- `docs/template-rules.md` — new §9 Theming architecture (CRITICAL); updated bezel (5px) and punch-hole (13px) specs.
- `docs/preferences.md` — added dark mode scoping rule with user's exact words; updated bezel and punch-hole specs.
- `docs/design-standards.md` — updated bezel (5px), punch-hole (13px), added bezel color and theming notes.
- `docs/navigation.md` — added theme-architecture.md to the index.

### 2025-01-15 — Homepage pill nav + template v4 (thin bezel, fixed signal, smaller battery, no scrollbar, mobile fullscreen)

**Homepage (`index.html`):**
- Top nav: both brand and button group now sit in **pill-shaped containers** (rounded-xl, border, card bg, shadow, backdrop-blur) — copied exactly from the AIO-STUFF reference. Two disconnected pills, no full-width bar.

**Template (`prototypes/_template/`) — v4:**
- Device bezel reduced 5px→**3px** (thinner, per feedback).
- Device corner radius set to **32px**.
- Battery icon made **smaller** (8×16px) and cleaner.
- **Fixed signal bars**: LEFT 2 bars now bright, RIGHT 2 bars dim (was reversed).
- **Hidden scrollbar** everywhere: app screens, side panels. Uses `scrollbar-width: none` + `::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none }`.
- **Mobile full-screen**: on ≤480px, the app fills the entire viewport (no device frame). A floating button lets users toggle back to framed view.
- Added `docs/preferences.md` — mandatory memory file capturing all user design preferences.

**Docs:**
- New `docs/preferences.md` (MANDATORY MEMORY FILE): all accumulated preferences — nav pills, hero 2-line, no footer, thin bezel, signal direction, portrait battery, no scrollbar, mobile fullscreen, color palette, references.
- `docs/template-rules.md`: updated frame specs (32px, 3px bezel), signal bar direction (left bright), added §6 scrollbar, §7 mobile fullscreen, §8 side panels.
- `docs/design-standards.md`: updated to match.
- `docs/navigation.md`: added preferences.md to the index.

### 2025-01-15 — Homepage nav/hero cleanup + template v3 (new status bar, side panels, more screens)

**Homepage (`index.html`):**
- Top nav: removed the full-width bar. Now two disconnected floating groups (brand left, Repo+theme right) with page background between them — nothing connects them, per feedback.
- Hero: removed eyebrow text and lead paragraph. H1 split into two lines: "Interactive mobile UI prototypes" / "live in your browser." (orange accent on line 2). Max 2 lines, no 3-line wrap.
- Prototype card right panel: replaced plain text stats with mini-charts — a component-breakdown donut + a per-screen interactions bar chart + screen/component counts.
- Removed the bottom links strip (Startup guide, Navigation map, etc.).
- Removed the footer entirely.
- Updated stat cards (4 screens, 12 components) to match the new template.

**Template (`prototypes/_template/`) — v3:**
- Device corners reduced 36→28px; bezel reduced 10→5px (thinner, less rounded, per feedback).
- Status bar rebuilt per spec:
  - Wi-Fi (2 of 3 arcs bright) → Signal (2 of 4 bars bright) → Portrait battery → Battery % to the right.
  - Punch-hole camera centered.
  - Bluetooth removed.
  - Battery is now portrait (vertical); fill grows from bottom, driven by JS.
- Text-selection fully fixed: entire `body` is `user-select: none`; global `selectstart` + `dragstart` listeners cancel any remaining selection. No text is selectable anywhere in the prototype (except input fields).
- 4 fully navigable screens: Home (scrollable feed with stories, posts, like buttons), Search (filterable input, chips, categories), Profile (avatar, stats, follow toggle, tabs, media grid), Settings (toggle switches, grouped rows).
- Left info panel: prototype name, description, screen list (clickable, syncs with device), tech tags.
- Right info panel: screen info (updates on view change), component donut, interaction bars, stats.
- Warm-cream palette aligned with homepage (orange primary `#f05100`).

**Docs:**
- `docs/template-rules.md`: updated frame specs (28px, 5px bezel), new status bar spec (Wi-Fi 2/3, signal 2/4, portrait battery, no Bluetooth), text-selection rule changed to "entire page non-selectable."
- `docs/design-standards.md`: updated frame + status bar specs to match.

### 2025-01-15 — Homepage redesign + template v2 + docs
- **Homepage (`index.html`):** complete redesign based on the approved AIO-STUFF reference. Warm-cream theme (`#f2e8da`/`#231e18`/`#f05100`), split top nav (logo+name left, Repo+theme toggle right), hero with eyebrow + H1 + 4 stat cards, two-up panel (feature bars + repo file-mix donut), CTA, and a restyled prototypes gallery with phone silhouettes flanked by left/right info panels. Light + dark themes.
- **Template (`prototypes/_template/`):**
  - Device corner radius reduced 44→36px (less rounded, per feedback).
  - Status bar rebuilt: punch-hole camera (centered), mobile-data signal bars, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, battery percentage + scaling fill glyph. Time stays left.
  - Fixed drag-to-copy issue: `.device` is `user-select: none`; only `.content` text is selectable; buttons/list rows re-assert `user-select: none`.
  - Battery fill driven by `script.js`; danger tint below 15%.
- **Docs:**
  - New `docs/template-rules.md` — authoritative rules for every prototype built from `_template/` (frame, status bar, theming, text-selection, interaction).
  - `docs/notification-protocol.md` promoted to MANDATORY MEMORY FILE with a 30-second copy-paste section at the top.
  - `docs/design-standards.md` updated for new status bar + 36px corners.
  - `docs/navigation.md` + `STARTUP.md` updated to reference the new files and homepage design language.
